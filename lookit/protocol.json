We will also have access to your account profile, demographic survey, and the child profile for the child who is participating, including changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may study your child's responses in connection with his or her previous responses to this or other studies run by our group, siblings' responses to this or other studies run by our group, or demographic survey responses.  We are primarily interested in your child's ability to match the rhythms that they hear. We will use specialist software to track your child’s movements in the video and give an estimation of their timing, and then look at this data in light of your survey responses. ",

We know that young children are brilliant at ‘sensing’ the rhythm of music but that they take some time to be able to coordinate their movement to it. We would like to know if the developing skill of toddlers to move in time with the beat of music is related to their general ability to monitor and adapt to the environment around them.",

            "procedures": "This study takes about 10 minutes to complete. We ask that your child is sat in a chair or highchair, within easy reach of a table. Your child will see some videos of a hand drumming (some fast, some slow) and will be asked to drum along on the table in front of them. We will then ask you to complete an online survey, which includes some fun interactive games to try with your little one. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating.",

This data may be used by Lookit to detect and fix technical problems or identify new featuresthat would be helpful; provide support to study researchers; assess data quality (for instance, how well an observer can tell which direction children are looking); evaluate the site's success in reaching a diverse population; and characterize family engagement (for instance, looking at what aspects of a study make parents more interested in coming back later).",

Raw data (for instance, the timing of movements) may be published when it cannot identify children. We never publish children's birthdates or names, and we never publish your demographic data in conjunction with your child's video.",

Video recordings and other data you enter are sent securely to our lab. At the end of the session, you will be prompted to choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings. You will have the option to withdraw your video data at this point.Data is stored securely on Lookit servers and by researchers. However, there is always a small risk that data transmitted over the internet may be intercepted or that the security of stored data may be compromised.No video clips will be published or shared unless you allow this when selecting aprivacy level. If we do not receive a consent recording (the video you'll make to the right) for this session and cannot verify that you agreed to participate, no other video from your session will be viewed."
