                "text": "Now that your little one has done some brilliant drumming for us, it is your turn to take part! You will shortly receive a link to a fun survey asking questions about whether your child is able to keep going with a tricky task, or try a new strategy. It involves some interactive games for you to try at home too - can they really wait to eat their favorite food?! \n\n It would be brilliant if you could complete the survey as soon as possible, and you can pause and come back to the survey if you need to, using the same link provided via email.\n\n Moving in time with the beat is related to children's general ability to be flexible and adaptive in their behavior. This study will give us new insights into the cognitive skills that feed into our sense of rhythm. Thank you so much for contributing to this research.We hope you enjoy the final part of the study!",
